# Exercise 7 - More than one changed file

1. Ensure you have a clean working directory

        git status

2. Edit one of your `fruits.txt`, add a few items

        blueberry
        strawberry
        etc.

3. Edit `appliances.txt` and add a few items

        dishwasher
        dryer
        etc.

4. Look at git status, paste the output here

        git status
        On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   appliances.txt
        modified:   fruits.txt


5. Can you commit both of the changed files in a single commit?

Yes you can.

6. After you do so, check that you have a clean working directory by running `git status`, and pasting the output here

On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean


7. Create a new file `equipment/furniture.txt`. Add content to both `vegetables.txt` and `furniture.txt`

8. How can you commit just one of the changed files?

Include the name of the file after the comment.

git commit -m "Updated furniture list" furniture.txt

9. Check your `git status`

10. What does red text mean in the output of `git status`?

It means that the file is untracked and will not be committed.

11. What does green text mean in the output of `git status`?

A change is ready to be committed.

12. How can you make a single file show in both red and green in the output of `git status`?

Stage a file and then modify its contents.
